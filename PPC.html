<p><em>What Personal Data do we use?</em> The Personal Data that we use is set out in Section A of this Children’s Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><em>Our “Legal Bases” for using Personal Data.</em> The GDPR requires us to have a “legal basis” for each way that we use Personal Data. Most commonly, we will rely on one of the following legal bases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Where we need to perform a contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with a Child (“<strong>Contractual Necessity</strong>”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests and the Child’s interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests (“<strong>Legitimate Interests</strong>”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where we need to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation (“<strong>Compliance with Law</strong>”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where we have specific consent to carry out the processing for the Purpose in question (“<strong>Consent</strong>”), in these cases we would need to get a Child’s parent’s consent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Purposes for Processing.</em>  We have set out below, in a table format, the legal bases we rely on in respect of the relevant Purposes for which we use Children’s Personal Data:</p>

</ul>
<p><em>Purpose limitation.</em>  We will only use Children’s Personal Data for the purposes for which we collected, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use Children’s Personal Data for an unrelated purpose, we will update this Privacy Policy. Please note that we may process Children’s Personal Data without their or their Parent’s knowledge or consent, in compliance with the above rules, where this is required or permitted by law (including the GDPR).</p>
<p><em>What happens when you do not provide necessary Personal Data or you withdraw consent?</em>  Where we <em><strong>need</strong></em> to process a Child’s Personal Data either to comply with law, or to perform the terms of a contract we have with them and they fail to provide that data when requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying to enter into. Similarly, if we rely on Consent to process Children’s Personal Data, they or their parent may withdraw that Consent, but if this happens, we may not be able to provide certain services or features.</p>

The Personal Data information that we collect from and about Children will be stored and processed in the EU and may not be stored and processed in other countries outside of Europe.

<p><strong>Children's Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>UAB Travel Union - September 2020</p>
<p>LAST REVISED ON August 21st,2025</p>
<p>UAB "Travel Union" (hereinafter - "TU" or "we") is an electronic money institution, company registration number 305106882, which has an electronic money institution license of the Bank of Lithuania no. LB001966, whose registered office is Konstitucijos pr. 7, 09307 Vilnius.</p>
<p>TU, our mobile application, provides a forum for all family members, including children between the ages of 7 and 18 (" Children " or " You ") to use TU Wallet and/or TU Card, pay for things and learn how to use money.</p>
<p>Your parent or legal guardian who looks after you (“Parent”) has opened a TU account and/or a TU card for you.</p>
<p>Parents can check how you're using your account, where and how much you're spending, and how much money you have in your account (so they know when to top it up). Using the TU mobile app will teach you financial responsibility, money management skills, not to mention that the TU Wallet and TU Card are much safer than using cash.</p>
<p>Before you start using TU Wallet and/or TU Card, we would like to explain how we collect and use your Personal Data.</p>
<p>Most importantly, your parents can see your personal data and are responsible for your account. TU may also see your personal data because we need to use it to manage your account.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about your Personal Data and how we look after it, please email us at <a href="mailto:dpo@mytu.co">dpo@mytu.co</a> or consult your parents.</p>
<p><strong>A. What personal data we collect about you</strong></p>
<p><em>What do we mean by "personal data"?</em> Personal data is information we hold about you. This includes things like your name, date of birth, mother's name, father's name and email address and phone number. These are just a few examples of what your data is. There is a lot of other data that we don't use.</p>
<p>You can sign up (with certain restrictions and parental permission) to explore the TU mobile app, use the TU Wallet and/or Card to pay for items, and learn financial literacy skills at the same time. But in order for you to do this, we need to collect certain information about you.</p>
<p>When your parents opened a TU Wallet and/or TU Card, they gave us your information. We need this information to set up your account and allow you to use the TU Wallet and/or TU Card. In addition, we are required by law to collect and store some of your data.</p>
<p>TU collects only limited information about you as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Name surname;</li>
  <li>Identity card or passport;</li>
  <li>Birth certificate;</li>
  <li>Date, month and year of birth;</li>
  <li>Telephone number;</li>
  <li>Email address;</li>
  <li>Your parent's email address, phone number we use to request parental consent;</li>
  <li>Custodian documents;</li>
  <li>Content of correspondence;</li>
  <li>Payment information such as date, amount, location, store where the payment was made;</li>
  <li>Face image.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also collect information about what you do inside the TU App – for example, when you order a card, when you upload your ID, how long it takes from creating your account until your first payment, or when you close your account.</p>
<p>This information helps us make sure the TU App works properly, is safe, and gets better over time. We do not use this information to show you ads or send you newsletters.</p>
<p><em>Use of anonymous information.</em> If the information collected from you does not identify you, or does not allow us to contact you or your device, we may use and disclose it for any purpose to the extent permitted by applicable law.</p>
<p><em>No ads!</em> We do not serve ads based on information collected from you.</p>
<p><em>No newsletters</em> ! Our email newsletters are for adults only - they are not tailored or directed at you. You should not attempt to sign up for email newsletters.</p>
<p><em>Permanent identifiers.</em> When you interact with the TU Mobile App, certain technical information may be collected automatically to make the TU Mobile App work properly, stay safe, and improve over time. For this, we use tools such as Google Firebase (for crash reporting and performance monitoring) and Google Analytics (for technical statistics). These tools only collect aggregated technical data and do not identify you personally. We do not use this information for advertising, targeting, or marketing.</p>
<p><em>What happens when you or your parents do not provide the necessary information about you or withdraw consent?</em> When we need your information because we are required to do so by law or we have to enter into a contract with your parents, we may prevent you from using the TU mobile app. Similarly, if we need your parental consent to process your data and your parent withdraws consent, we may not be able to provide you with certain services or features.</p>
<p><strong>B. Why We Collect Information About You</strong></p>
<p>We only collect information about you when it is necessary. There are many reasons for using your personal data:</p>
<ul>
  <li>so that we can create an account for you and allow you to use the TU mobile app;</li>
  <li>determine your age;</li>
  <li>allow you to use TU Wallet and/or TU Card to pay for items you purchase;</li>
  <li>to answer your questions or provide you with requested information;</li>
  <li>verify that the account is being used by you;</li>
  <li>send a welcome pack and information such as tips on how to use your account to save money;</li>
  <li>to analyze and improve the services we offer;</li>
  <li>handle any feedback or complaints;</li>
  <li>ensure security in the TU mobile app;</li>
  <li>where we are required or permitted by law;</li>
  <li>to understand how children and parents use the TU App so we can improve the service and make it safer.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Limitation of purpose.</em> We will only use your data for the purposes stated, unless we reasonably believe that it needs to be used for another reason and that reason is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your data for an unrelated purpose, we will update this Privacy Policy and notify you.</p>
<p>We only collect your information if your parents give consent, your parents have signed a contract with us, we are required to do so by law, or if we have a legitimate interest in improving our services.</p>
<p><strong>C. How and why is information about you shared?</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes we need to disclose your information to third parties if we have your parent's permission or if we are required to do so by any applicable law or as part of the performance of a contract.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of who we share your information with:</p>
<ul>
  <li>other companies that help us operate or manage the TU Mobile App;</li>
  <li>other people or companies who help us to ensure that we comply with the law and act fairly (such as lawyers and accountants);</li>
  <li>other companies if they buy our company;</li>
  <li>official people who monitor our activities to make sure we are looking after you properly;</li>
  <li>our other companies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes we may share anonymous or grouped information (for example, statistics about how many children use the TU App) with companies that help us improve the TU App. These currently include Google Analytics and Google Firebase, which provide us with technical statistics, crash reports, and performance monitoring. This information is used only in aggregated or pseudonymized form to help us make the app safer and better. It cannot be used to identify you personally, and it is never used for advertising or marketing purposes.</p>
<p><strong>D. How can you use our mobile app?</strong></p>
<p>Your parents must already be TU customers in order to have a TU Wallet and/or TU Card. You can download the TU mobile app only with parental consent and personal information.</p>
<p>To set up your account on the TU mobile app:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your parents must register you through their account on the TU mobile app; read and sign the contract on your behalf; submit your Personal data, guardianship documents and sign an electronic consent form for the processing of your Personal data. Only then can you download the TU mobile app, fill out the registration forms and complete the registration process.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all cases, in order to download and access the TU mobile app, you must obtain parental consent to process your Personal Data.</p>
<p>In the case of children's accounts, if all the forms and confirmations mentioned above are submitted/confirmed by one of the parents, the contract must be valid and legally binding.</p>
<p>If your parents give us consent at this stage, TU will carry out the activity for which consent was required. If not, we will not provide any services.</p>
<p><strong>E. How can your parents access, change or delete information about you?</strong></p>
<p><em>Deleting your information and account.</em></p>
<p>If your parents:</p>
<ul>
  <li>want us to stop collecting information from or about you;</li>
  <li>believe that you are participating in activities on the TU mobile app that use your personal information without their consent;</li>
  <li>want us to no longer use and/or delete personal information we have collected from you online;</li>
  <li>no longer wish you to have a TU Account and/or a TU Wallet and/or Card,</li>
</ul>
<p>TU will delete your profile and any personal information that can be deleted upon request.</p>
<p>Your parents can exercise these rights through our Data Protection Officer by emailing .</p>
<p><em>Accessing or changing your account and any personal information we collect.</em></p>
<p>Your parents can at any time:</p>
<ul>
  <li>access or modify your TU Account or TU Card;</li>
  <li>change the personal information we have collected about you;</li>
</ul>
<p>by clicking on the "My Account" link or by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@mytu.co">support@mytu.co</a> or by writing to us at the address below.</p>

<p><strong>F. How Long We Keep Your Personal Information</strong></p>
<p>We need to keep your personal information for different amounts of time, depending on the situation.</p>
<p>We will keep your information while your parent or guardian says it’s okay.</p>
<p>If you stop using your TU Wallet account, we may keep your information for up to 10 years.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we may need to keep your information for longer if the law says we must, or if someone takes us to court and we need your information to protect ourselves. That means even if you ask us to delete your information, we might not be able to do it right away.</p>
<p>Here are some more details:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If your parent’s permission is still valid and there are no other legal rules, we will keep your information.</li>
  <li>If we collect your information to follow anti-money laundering laws, we will keep it for up to 8 years. Sometimes, we may keep it for 2 more years if a government agency asks us to.</li>
  <li>Messages between you and us will be kept for 5 years after your account ends.</li>
  <li>If you or your parent sends us a request, complaint, or message, we will keep it for 1 year after we reply. If our answer is challenged, we will keep it for 5 years after the final decision.</li>
</ul>
<p>If any law tells us how long to keep your data, we will follow that law.</p>
<p>When the time for keeping your data is over, we will delete it or remove anything that shows it belongs to you as soon as we can.</p>
<p>Information about how you use the TU App (for example, actions and steps taken in the app) is normally kept for up to 2 years. After this time, it will either be deleted or changed so that no one can tell it belongs to you.</p>
<p><strong>G. What are your rights?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Information.</strong> You have the right to be informed about how we use your Personal Data.</p>
<p><strong>Access.</strong> You have the right to request to see any personal data we hold about you.</p>
<p><strong>Correction.</strong> You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate or incomplete Personal Data we hold about you.</p>
<p><strong>Deletion.</strong> You have the right to request that we delete all of your Personal Data.</p>
<p><strong>Objection.</strong> You have the right to object to any of the reasons for which we collect your Personal Data.</p>
<p><strong>Limitation.</strong> You have the right to request that we stop processing your Personal Data in certain situations (for example, to find out if your information is correct).</p>
<p><strong>Portability.</strong> You have the right to request that we provide your Personal Data to you or another company.</p>
<p><strong>Withdraw consent.</strong> You and your parents have the right to withdraw your consent for any processing based on it as a legal basis. If you withdraw your consent to the use of analytics or advertising cookies, we will immediately stop collecting new data for those purposes. Existing identifiers (such as cookies) will be deleted or disabled, and no further data will be sent to third-party providers. Any information already anonymized or aggregated will not be affected, as it can no longer be linked to you.</p>
<p><em>How to exercise these rights?</em> These rights can be exercised using our TU mobile app. There is no charge for this. We may need to ask you for more information related to your inquiry to help us confirm that it is you. TU will review your request and provide a response within one month of receiving your request. In some cases, we may need more time to respond to your request.</p>
<p><em>The right to complain.</em> We would like to be able to resolve any questions, requests or complaints we receive from you or your parents. However, if you or your parents believe that we could not help you, your parents can contact their local data protection supervisory authority <a href="https://vdai.lrv.lt/lt/veiklos-sritys-1/skundu-nagrinejimas">https://vdai.lrv.lt/lt/veiklos-sritys-1/skundu-nagrinejimas</a>.</p>

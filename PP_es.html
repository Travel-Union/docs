  <h2>Where is your data stored?</h2>
  <p>Our cloud storage provider stores personal data in the EU and EEA, so your information is normally stored in this area. We do not transfer data to third parties. If information is transferred outside the EU/European Economic Area, we will ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place. If your Personal Data is transferred to a country that is not subject to the EU Commission&#39;s eligibility decision, the data is adequately protected in accordance with standard contractual terms approved by the EU Commission, the relevant Privacy Shield Certificate or third-party binding rules.</p>

  <h2>When you data is processed through social media</h2>
  <p>We use the following social media plugins on our website: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram. The plug-ins can be identified by the social network buttons marked with the logo of the respective social network provider.</p>
  <p>We installed these plugins using the so-called 2-click solution. This means that when you browse our website, the providers of these social media plugins will not initially collect personal data. Only by clicking on one of the plug-ins will your Personal Data be transferred: After activating the plug-in, the data is automatically transferred to the corresponding plug-in provider and stored by them (in the case of US providers, your Personal Data will be stored in the US).</p>
  <p>We have no influence on the collected data and the data processing operations performed by the providers, nor do we know the full scope, purposes or retention periods of data collection.</p>
  <p>You can find information about the purpose and scope of data collection and their processing by the plug-in provider in the respective data protection policies of these providers, where you will also find more information about your rights and privacy protection options.</p>

  <h2>What security measures ensure compliance with data protection?</h2>
  <p>We strive to maintain appropriate security standards and have implemented strong technical and organizational measures to protect your Personal Data in accordance with the latest technologies, in particular to protect data from loss, falsification or access by unauthorized third parties. When transmitting highly sensitive Personal Data over the Internet, we use only encrypted transmission routes and comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS), which is a set of policies and procedures designed to optimize security. Once we receive your personal data, we will use strict procedures and safeguards to prevent unauthorized access. Third parties (ie external companies) provide us with data processing services and are therefore obliged to comply with our data privacy rules. External service providers are supervised by a data protection officer to ensure compliance with these rules.</p>

  <h2>How long do you store my personal data?</h2>
  <p>We will retain your personal data for as long as it is necessary for the purposes for which your data was collected and processed, including the purposes to comply with legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or reporting obligations. This means that we store your data as much as it is necessary to provide the services and as much as required by the storage requirements in laws and regulations. If the legal acts of the Republic of Lithuania do not provide for the applicable data storage term, we determine it, taking into account the legal purpose of data storage, the legal basis and the principles of legal personal data processing.</p>

  <p>The conditions for the storage of personal data for the purposes of personal data processing specified in this privacy policy are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>while your consent is valid, if there are no other legal requirements that must be met when processing personal data;</li>
    <li>in the case of concluding and executing contracts - until the contract concluded between you and us is valid and up to 10 years from the end of the relationship between you and us;</li>
    <li>personal data collected in fulfillment of obligations under the Law on Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing are stored for up to 8 (eight) years in accordance with the procedure established by the Law on Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing of the Republic of Lithuania. The storage period can be extended for a period of no longer than 2 (two) years, if there is a reasonable request from the competent authority;</li>
    <li>correspondence with you in paper or electronic form shall be retained 5 years after the expiration of the contract or the end of the business relationship with you.</li>
    <li>your requests, complaints, notifications shall be retained for 1 year after the Company takes decision on the requests, complaints or notifications mentioned.  In case decision is challenged, the retention period is 5 years after final decision.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In cases where data storage terms are specified in legal acts, legal acts apply.</p>

  <p>We may store your personal data for a longer period when:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>it is necessary for us to defend against existing or threatened claims or to enforce our rights or to properly resolve a dispute, complaint or claim;</li>
    <li>there is a reasonable suspicion of illegal activity;</li>
    <li>required by applicable law;</li>
    <li>User interaction and analytics data will generally be retained for up to 2 (two) years in order to allow us to analyze usage trends and improve the TU App. After this period, such data will either be deleted or fully anonymized so that it can no longer be linked to you.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>At the end of the storage period, we will delete and/or reliably and irrevocably depersonalize your data as soon as possible, within a reasonable time required to perform such an action.</p>

  <h2>What rights do you have?</h2>
  <p>You have a number of rights under data protection law. These rights and how you can exercise them are described in this section. We may need to ask you for proof of your identity in order to respond to a request to exercise any of the rights set out in this section, and we may also need to ask you to provide more information, such as helping us locate your personal data to which your request relates.</p>

  <p>TU respects the customer&#39;s rights to access, manage and control personal data processed by TU. Upon receipt of a customer request to exercise any of the rights listed below, TU will review the customer&#39;s request and provide a response promptly and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. This term may be extended if the client&#39;s request is complex or due to the volume of received requests, TU cannot prepare a response within the previously set deadline. In such a case, TU informs the client about the extension of the deadline for preparing a response to the client&#39;s request and indicates a specific deadline for preparing the response.</p>

  <p>We may refuse to comply with your request if an exception set out in the GDPR applies and/or a restriction on the implementation of data subjects and/or your request is manifestly unreasonable or disproportionate. If we refuse to comply with your request, we will give you the reason for such refusal in writing.</p>

  <p>When we collect and use your data, you have the right to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>A right to be informed.</strong> You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily understandable information about how we use your personal data.</li>
    <li><strong>A right to access your information.</strong> You have a right to ask us to send you a copy of all the personal data that we hold about you (subject to some exceptions).</li>
    <li><strong>A right to an electronic copy of your information.</strong> You can also ask us to send you the mandatory Account Information that we hold about you in a common electronic format, or to ask us to transfer that data to a third party if you want us to and if it is technically feasible for us to do so.</li>
    <li><strong>A right to object to us processing your information.</strong> You have a right to object to us processing any personal data that we process where we are relying on legitimate interests as the legal basis of our processing (as set out in section 3 above). Your objection must be based on grounds that relate to your particular situation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you make a request to exercise your right to object, if we have compelling legitimate reasons to continue processing your personal data, we may continue to do so. Otherwise, we will stop processing your personal data.</p>
  <p>However, if you object to us using the personal data we need to provide the services, we may have to close your payment account because we will not be able to provide the services.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The right to ask us not to advertise to you.</strong> You can ask us not to send you direct marketing. You can do this by following the &#39;unsubscribe&#39; instructions in any marketing emails.</li>
    <li><strong>The right to request the correction of inaccurate data.</strong> You have the right to ask us to correct inaccurate data we hold about you. If we are convinced that the new data you have provided is accurate, we will correct your personal data as soon as possible.</li>
    <li><strong>The right to request that your data be deleted.</strong> You have the right to ask us to delete your personal data in certain circumstances, for example, if we have processed your data unlawfully or if we no longer need the data for the purposes specified in this privacy policy.</li>
    <li><strong>The right to restrict the processing of your data.</strong> You can ask us to restrict the processing of your personal data in certain circumstances, for example if you believe that the personal data is inaccurate and we need to check its accuracy, or if we no longer need the data but you require us to keep it in order to exercise your rights.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Restricting your personal data means that we only store your personal data and do not further process it unless you consent, or we need to process the data to make a legal claim or to protect a third party or the public.</p>
  <p><strong>Right to withdraw your permission.</strong> If you have given us consent to use your personal data, you can withdraw your consent at any time. It is lawful for us to use the personal data until you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent to the use of analytics or advertising cookies, we will immediately stop collecting new data for those purposes. Existing identifiers (such as cookies) will be deleted or disabled, and no further data will be sent to third-party providers. Any information already anonymized or aggregated will not be affected, as it can no longer be linked to you.</p>
